\subsection{Background}

Many children today have to take inhalation medications because of chronic or
acute lung disease such as asthma. Children can often find it difficult to use
the medication correctly, boring or even scary to take them, which means they
might object taking them, or forget to take them. Parents also sometimes
apply the medication incorrectly, apply the wrong treatment, or even forget to
give medication to their
child. This may lead to reduced effect of the medication, and the lung disease
may worsen and last longer, causing increased pressure on the public health
services, increased health related cost and lost working hours for the parents.
