Our Customer is NAAF (Norges Astma og Allergiforbund) and ``Sykehusapotekene i Norge''.  Contact information for both the customer and 
the development team is listed in the Introduction Chapter.  


The development team consists of Esben, Aleksander, Jørgen, Yngve and Eirik, all Computer Science students at NTNU.
The students are taking this course as a part of their master degree in computer science.
In very brief summary, our assignment and project goal was to create a better and more fun way to take asthma-medication with use of
mobile technology.
