\subsection{LaTeX folder structure}
\label{sec:latexfolderstructure}
The report will appear as a seperate project. In order to keep track of what is what, and in order to not having too many Git-conflicts, 
we will have a seperate folder for each chapter. This folder should be the name of the chapter, without spaces. 
If we are writing long sections, these should appear in a seperate document, with section name as the 
filename.
