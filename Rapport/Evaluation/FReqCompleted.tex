\section{Functional Requirements completed}
\label{sec:frcompleted}
Table \ref{tab:functionalrequirementscompleted} shows an overview of the functional requirements stated in Section \ref{sec:functionalRequirements}, and whether they are completed or not.
As one may notice, all functionality with high priority is completed. The parts that are not completed can be classified as ``nice to have''-features, but are not vital 
for the prototype.
