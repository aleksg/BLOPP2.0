\subsection{Background}

Many children today have to take inhalation medicines because of chronic or
acute lung disease such as asthma. Children often find it difficult to use
the medication correctly, boring or even scary to take them, which means they
might object or forget to take them. Parents also sometimes
apply the medication incorrectly, apply the wrong treatment, or even forget to
give the medication to their
children. This may lead to reduced effect of the medication, and the lung disease
may worsen and last longer, causing increased pressure on the public health
services, increased health related cost and lost working hours for the parents.
