\section{Project Information}
\label{sec:prosec}
\subsection{Project Name}
The name of this project is ``BLOPP", and was decided by the customer. BLOPP stands for ``Barns 
LegemiddelOPPlevelse'' (``Children's experience with medication'').  

\input{Introduction/Background}

\subsection{The task}
Our task was to implement two Android applications, one application for the parents, Guardian Application (GAPP), 
and one application for children, Children Application (CAPP). In addition, an application for the Karotz platform 
should be created to assist and to an extent substitute the GAPP and CAPP mobile applications. 

The high level functional requirements for these applications are to be found in Table 
\ref{tab:highfuncitionalrequirements}. The functional requirements for all applications are described in more detail 
in Section \ref{sec:functionalRequirements}

		\bf{\#} & \bf{Description} \\  \hline \\

		GHR1 & The application must alert the parent(s) when it is time for a medication/treatment for their child. \\ \\
		GHR2 & The application must log the health status of their child, according to section \ref{sec:trafficlight}. \\ \\ 
		GHR3 & The application should log pollen casts for the area the child is in, and which medications were taken each day.\\ \\ 
		GHR4 & The application must store medical plans for their child. These plans concern asthma medications, and contains which medicines should be taken at which times.\\ \\ 
		GHR5 & The application must provide instructions on how to use different medications. These instructions may be pictures or text, provided by NAAF. \\ \\ \hline \\

		CHR1 & The application should distract the children during a treatment. \\ \\ 
		CHR2 & The application should gamify their experience with medication.  \\ \\ \hline \\

		KHR1 & The application should alert children and parent(s) when it is time for a medication/treatment for the children.  \\ \\ 
		KHR2 & The application should distract the children during a treatment. \\ \\ 
		KHR3 & The application should encourage children to take medication through interactivity and gamification.  \\

\subsection{Measurement of project effort}
The customer was seeking a documented prototype of a system which could be used for future 
development and for getting additional funding for further development of the project. The customer wanted
the prototype tested on children suffering from diseases causing breathing problems and their parents, in order
to determine whether or not such a system was an adequate solution to the problem. The system should be
compatible with Android v4.0 or newer versions, and should be intuitive to use. The resulting prototype should be well documented
to ensure that further development would be able to continue development after the end of the project.

\subsection{General terms}
We were to make two applications for Android devices and one for Karotz. Originally the customer wanted the smart phone applications made for iOS, 
but since we did not have Apple computers and iPhones, and the customer did not have the funding to provide them, we 
switched to the Android platform. We had at our disposal a Karotz robot with a yellow and a green Nanoz controller,
a Github repository, an AgileZen board and could request an Android tablet to be used for testing if necessary.

\subsection{Planned effort}
The course description states an expected effort of 25 hours per week per student. The course lasted for 13 weeks,
resulting in a total expected effort of 325 hours per student, at a total of 1625 for the team altogether.

\subsection{Schedule of results}
The applications were scheduled to be completed within November 10th. The time we had left after this, was used for fixing
critical errors, and completing the report.

\subsection{Report Outline}
The report is outlined in Table \ref{tab:chapters}.
