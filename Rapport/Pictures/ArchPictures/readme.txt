WORKING!!!
Note to readers:
This is still very early in the process, and the architecture WILL change over time, this is just to give us something to work with. We do not expect everyone of you to necessarily understand the class diagrams, but Ole may find it interesting. 

For the children's shop, we refer to the "ER-diagram" of the database model that will be made available soon. The models implemented will be very similar to these.

We have split up the class diagrams in three four parts, one package diagram that will apply to both AdultClassDiagram and ChildrenClassDiagram. The package diagram represents the folder structure of the class files. The last diagram, KarotzClassDiagram will probably change a lot, since some parts of the api is still unclear, but it is a starting point for us at least. 

We will probably try to finish off the process of making the architecture during the week, and hopefully we can present it to you during next meeting.

If anyone has any early comments, please write it in comments.txt, and put your name on top.
