\section{Pollen forecast}
\label{sec:pollencast}
NAAF\cite{naafasthma} states that asthma- and pollen treatment needs to be seen in correlation.
Children may feel worse during pollen season than the rest of the year. We intend to give parents more analyzing tools by being able to see
connections between asthma symptoms and different types of pollen by using pollen data. It may occur that asthma is not the original source of 
a child's condition, but an allergy against a certain pollen is the source.  
NAAF hosts a pollen forecast at \url{http://pollenvarslingen.no/} which we intend to use. We have been given a user key for this cast, even though
they do not normally distribute this sort of information to application developers.
