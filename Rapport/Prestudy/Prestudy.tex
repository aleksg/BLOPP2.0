\section{Children with asthma}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Hva med en seksjon først generelt om astma, medisiner og medisineringsmetoder. Så mer direkte mot barn og astma. Og så la neste seksjon komme med problemene dette medfører (slik det er nå).

Asthma is a chronic inflamatory disease that affects the airways and lungs.\cite{naafastma} It is often more prominent in children, who are more 
active and easily excited than adults. The asthma is typically triggered by excitement, physical activity, rashes or allergies. The problem is 
managed by multiple medicines, 
with different schedules as to when to take them, and how much to take, depending on the condition of the child. There are inhalation medicines that 
consists of either small dust particles that effect the lungs locally, or saltwater that are inhaled as vapor, either alone or combined with other 
medicines to loosen up slime. Among these inhalation medicines is Ventoline and Flutide, seen in figure \ref{fig:ventoline} and \ref{fig:flutide}. 
There are also pills and liquid medicines that either affects the immune system or affects the body globally, not just locally in the lungs.

The medicines can also be divided into medicines that have immediate effects, and are used during an asthma attack, while other medicines are preventative, 
and is taken on a regular schedule. These preventative medicines are targeted at bolstering your immune system before going to certain areas, or days
where the child is likely to be in contact with materials it is allergic to.	

With some of the inhalation medicines it's difficult to time the inhalation with the release of medicine, and here an inhalation chamber, or inhalation 
mask, is used. When the child has taken the nebulizer this way, usually once or twice a day, they must remember to wash their mouth afterwards.

Figure \ref{fig:paperprototype} shows an image of a nebulizer machine. The nebulizer machines often makes alot of noise, and can 
be scary to children. The nebulizer treatment takes between 2-10 minutes, 1-4 times a day.

\section{Parents with children affected by asthma}

Parents of children with asthma face a series of challenges concerning the medication of their children. 
One of these challenges is to give the correct amount of medicine, the right type of medicine, at the 
correct time of the day. Many parents have experienced stressful mornings where they are late for work, 
their children are unwilling to take their medicine and they either do it in an incorrect manner, reducing the 
medicines effect, or not giving it at all. The medication plans can be hard to understand, even though they are 
designed to be easy, and it's typically only one of the parents that have been given the instructions from 
the doctor directly, making it even harder for the other one to do it correctly.

The children are not always happy about taking their medicine. The inhalation mask might be scary, the 
medication might interfere with their planned activities that day, or any number of other reasons the child 
might not want to take his/her medicine that day. Having to force a child to take their medicine could make the 
child associate taking the medicine with a negative experience, and it becomes increasingly difficult to 
give the medicine to the child. 

\section{The concept of gamification}

Gamification is the concept of applying game-design thinking to non-game applications to make them more fun 
and engaging. Nick Pelling (2011)\cite{pellingblog} writes that the term \emph{gamification} was introduced
in 2002, but was not popular before 2010 (Daniels, 2010\cite{danielsblog}).

Common techniques applied to introduce gamification to a process include, but are not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Achievements/badges
  \item Levels
  \item Leaderboards
  \item Progress bars
  \item Avatars
  \item Gifting
  \item Challenges
  \item Embedding of minigames
\end{itemize}

These techniques are all widely used. Here are some examples:
% footnote / bibliography alle
\begin{itemize}
  \item In games for platforms like Playstation and Xbox, gamification is frequently used
   to make people finish campaigns.(Hamari et.al, 2011\cite{trophies}) Trophies and achievements are used to motivate people to complete games 100\%. 
   You may have to collect every single item in the game, fight every boss and so on.
  \item Nike+ introduced gamification to training. (Zichermann et. al, 2011\cite{gamificationByDesign}) You can track how fast you run, your maximum pulse and so on, 
  and try to beat this target the next time you are running.
  \item You can ``check in'' to places you have been with Google Maps, Facebook, Foursquare, Google+, GoWalla, and similar applications.  
  \item Airline companies uses bonus points as motivation for customers to fly more with a company. (Gamification Wiki, 2012\cite{freqflyer}) At a certain 
  level of these points, you may get one more flight for free, get a free upgrade to a better seat and so on. 
\end{itemize}

We hope gamification will help making children's treatment as enjoyable as possible. Michael 
Wu has proven that gamification has an impact on human motivation. Wu presents: ``Game 
mechanics and game dynamics are able to positively influence human behavior 
because they are designed to drive the players above the activation threshold (i.e. the upper 
right of the ability-motivation axis), and then trigger them into specific actions'' (Wu, 2011)\cite{gamification101}.  

The gamification elements most suited for children, is gifting and embedding of minigames. The gifting needs to be visual, and
the two elements can be interwoven to increase the effect, where the minigames changes according to what gifts you've already
achieved. Another way that can implement gifting targeted at children, is to implement a currency system, for example coins, and reward them
with physical rewards when they reach a certain amount of coins. The rewards could be all from small toys and candy, to larger items, depending
on the amount of coins, and the tasks performed to get the coins. A point here is to make sure the currency is very visual, to make sure even
young children understand how many coins they have.
The implementation of minigames would help greatly in distracting children during tedious tasks like nebulization treatments.

Gamification has a lot of positive sides, but it may have bad sides if gamification is done the wrong way.
The fact that we are using gamification to motivate children, makes this an even more serious concern. If children feel that
they are stuck in a game, motivation may very easily be broken down. So whatever concept we come up with, it has to be 
to motivate the children at all time. They cannot feel stuck with our app. This concept is up to the customer to create, 
while we will be implementing it.  

As written above, gamification may have negative effects on users. Anderson-Rainie (2012)\cite{andersonrainie} show results
that users are likely to not be motivated or feel that they are manipulated into completing a task. The 
research also show that users are likely to feel that gamification is too childish, and that gamification 
is a trend that will disappear within a few years.
