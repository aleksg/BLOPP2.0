\title{Effort Registration}
During planning, an estimation work hours should be made. 
All work done on the project should be logged and archived, 
and that data should be collected in a spreadsheet that can 
be compared with the estimation. All work registration is to 
be done through e-mail directly to the \emph{Project Manager}, 
or a designated \emph{Log Manager}. A template will be used for 
these e-mails, which contain basic information about the work done, 
i.e. time spent, area and additional comments.
