Møtereferat 03.09.12 (workshop/kundemøte)

Attending: Aleks, Eirik, Ole, Hanne, Marikken, Elin

The main item discussed during this meeting was the general layout of the
product, in preparation for performing an early usability test later in the
day. After we last week presented our ideas for the application, we got the
following feedback and revisions during this meeting:

-	The customer wanted the application to be split into two applications,
	one for the parents containing the settings, manual/instructions, the
	logging and changing medicationplan. The other part would be for the 
	child, where you can enter a shop/reward system, activate distractions
	and see how to correctly apply medicine.

-	The two applications will be connected through an underlying system keeping
	the database and both clientapplications consistent.

-	There were minor changes to our gui, mainly around the parentapplication,
	which they thought were to complicated.

-	They wanted more focus on getting the karotz operational and working it into
	the reminding/distraction part.

-	The customer also made it clear that the reminder and distraction parts
	would likely get priority when we start our sprints.
